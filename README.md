# webSafari

## Description

I plan on making a website for a safari/ecosystem management sandbox game. The game itself will be a canvas element controlled by an implementation of p5.js. The game will center around allowing the user to place down different animals/plants in the canvas area and see how they interact with each other. There will be three base types of agents (carnivores, herbivores, and plants). The twist will be to add genetic algorithms on top that will evolve agents into new species over time. The game itself should be very simple coding however with my unfamiliarity with web environments, I suspect I may have to do a bit of code optimization to make it run well in a browser. As for the website, it will have a two-page layout. One page will be the home, where the user will see the title and the description/guide for the game. The other page will be the game itself; this will include the canvas, but also radio buttons so that users can select which base type of animal they want to put down. The visual design of the site will be very simplistic. The goal is to make something that won’t catch the eye at all (so as to not distract from the game itself). Another part of the visual design is the game itself; for this, I believe I will also take a simplistic route. The animals/plants will take a more abstract form (triangles, squares, grey/transparent symbols). This visual design is to make the project appear as old-school and sophisticated. For each iteration of the project, I plan on having more and more features of the p5.js mastered and implemented.

## What to learn to accomplish this

### p5.js
 * will try to accomplish this by analyzing the code from the [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/introduction/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code)) as well as p5.js tutorials if I feel I need them.
### AI & Environment in JavaScript
 * Shouldn’t be anywhere as much of a problem as I know how to do the algorithms I want in other languages.
