# webSafari

## Description

webSafari is a casual bullet hell game where you just try to dodge enemies that are throwing themselves at you. The game itself is be a canvas element controlled by an implementation of p5.js. The game centers around the user moving a herbivore around the screen, moving it away from predators. The game itself is very simple coding, with minimal optimizations, it runs fine in a browser and surprisingly it only chugs minimalistically on mobile devices. On mobile specifically - it is playable, but not very enjoyable. The website has five pages; one for the landing, documentation and then the 3 game pages. The visual design of the site is very simplistic. The goal was to make something that wonâ€™t catch the eye at all (so as to not distract from the game itself). Another part of the visual design is the game itself; for this, I believe I will also take a simplistic route. The aesthetics of the game are very minimalistic in order to give a more focused viewpoint.

NOTE: Originally this concept was completely different, I had to reduce my project by A LOT in order to even finish it on time because of unforseen circumstances.

## What I learned to accomplish this

### p5.js
 * analyzed the code from the [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/introduction/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code)) as well as experimented within p5.js.
### AI & Environment in JavaScript
 * "translated" from C# into javascript by me.
